1 Introduction
**************

Org-roam is a tool for networked thought.  It reproduces some of Roam
Research’s (https://roamresearch.com/) (1) key features within Org-mode
(https://orgmode.org/).

   Org-roam allows for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking: with
Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking fun and easy.
Org-roam augments the Org-mode syntax, and will work for anyone already
using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

   Org-roam leverages the mature ecosystem around Org-mode.  For
example, it has first-class support for org-ref
(https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref) for citation management, and is
able to piggyback off Org’s excellent LaTeX and source-block evaluation
capabilities.

   Org-roam provides these benefits over other tooling:

   • *Privacy and Security:* Your personal wiki belongs only to you,
     entirely offline and in your control.  Encrypt your notes with GPG.

   • *Longevity of Plain Text:* Unlike web solutions like Roam Research,
     the notes are first and foremost plain Org-mode files – Org-roam
     simply builds an auxiliary database to give the personal wiki
     superpowers.  Having your notes in plain-text is crucial for the
     longevity of your wiki.  Never have to worry about proprietary web
     solutions being taken down.  The notes are still functional even if
     Org-roam ceases to exist.

   • *Free and Open Source:* Org-roam is free and open-source, which
     means that if you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may
     choose to extend Org-roam, or open a pull request.

   • *Leverage the Org-mode ecosystem:* Over the decades, Emacs and
     Org-mode has developed into a mature system for plain-text
     organization.  Building upon Org-mode already puts Org-roam
     light-years ahead of many other solutions.

   • *Built on Emacs:* Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing
     text, and Org-roam inherits many of the powerful text-navigation
     and editing packages available to Emacs.

2 Target Audience
*****************

Org-roam is a tool that will appear unfriendly to anyone unfamiliar with
Emacs and Org-mode, but it is also extremely powerful to those willing
to put effort in mastering the intricacies.  Org-roam stands on the
shoulders of giants.  Emacs was first created in 1976, and remains the
tool of choice for many for editing text and designing textual
interfaces.  The malleability of Emacs allowed the creation of Org-mode,
an all-purpose plain-text system for maintaining TODO lists, planning
projects, and authoring documents.  Both of these tools are incredibly
vast and require significant time investment to master.

   Org-roam assumes only basic familiarity with these tools.  It is not
difficult to get up and running with basic text-editing functionality,
but one will only fully appreciate the power of building Roam
functionality into Emacs and Org-mode when the usage of these tools
become more advanced.

   One key advantage to Org-roam is that building on top of Emacs gives
it malleability.  This is especially important for note-taking
workflows.  It is our belief that note-taking workflows are extremely
personal, and there is no one tool that’s perfect for you.  Org-mode and
Org-roam allows you to discover what works for you, and build that
perfect tool for yourself.

   If you are new to the software, and choose to take this leap of
faith, I hope you find yourself equally entranced as Neal Stephenson
was.

     Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the
     same way that the noonday sun does the stars.  It is not just
     bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.  –
     Neal Stephenson, In the Beginning was the Command Line (1998)

3 A Brief Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method
*************************************************

Org-roam provides utilities for maintaining a digital slip-box.  This
section aims to provide a brief introduction to the “slip-box”, or
“Zettelkasten” method.  By providing some background on the method, we
hope that the design decisions of Org-roam will become clear, and that
will aid in using Org-roam appropriately.  In this section we will
introduce terms commonly used within the Zettelkasten community and the
Org-roam forums.

   The Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing.  It
places heavy emphasis on connecting ideas, building up a web of thought.
Hence, it is well suited for knowledge workers and intellectual tasks,
such as conducting research.  The Zettelkasten can act as a research
partner, where conversations with it may produce new and surprising
lines of thought.

   This method is attributed to German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who
using the method had produced volumes of written works.  Luhmann’s
slip-box was simply a box of cards.  These cards are small – often only
large enough to fit a single concept.  The size limitation encourages
ideas to be broken down into individual concepts.  These ideas are
explicitly linked together.  The breakdown of ideas encourages
tangential exploration of ideas, increasing the surface for thought.
Making linking explicit between notes also encourages one to think about
the connections between concepts.

   At the corner of each note, Luhmann ascribed each note with an
ordered ID, allowing him to link and jump between notes.  In Org-roam,
we simply use hyperlinks.

   Org-roam is the slip-box, digitalized in Org-mode.  Every zettel
(card) is a plain-text, Org-mode file.  In the same way one would
maintain a paper slip-box, Org-roam makes it easy to create new zettels,
pre-filling boilerplate content using a powerful templating system.

   *Fleeting notes*

   A slip-box requires a method for quickly capturing ideas.  These are
called *fleeting notes*: they are simple reminders of information or
ideas that will need to be processed later on, or trashed.  This is
typically accomplished using ‘org-capture’ (see *note (org)Capture::),
or using Org-roam’s daily notes functionality (see *note
org-roam-dailies::).  This provides a central inbox for collecting
thoughts, to be processed later into permanent notes.

   *Permanent notes*

   Permanent notes are further split into two categories: *literature
notes* and *concept notes*.  Literature notes can be brief annotations
on a particular source (e.g.  book, website or paper), that you’d like
to access later on.  Concept notes require much more care in authoring:
they need to be self-explanatory and detailed.  Org-roam’s templating
system supports the addition of different templates to facilitate the
creation of these notes.

   For further reading on the Zettelkasten method, “How to Take Smart
Notes” by Sonke Ahrens is a decent guide.

4 Installation
**************

Org-roam can be installed using Emacs’ package manager or manually from
its development repository.

* Menu:

* Installing from MELPA::
* Installing from Source::
* Installation Troubleshooting::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Installing from MELPA,  Next: Installing from Source,  Up: Installation

4.1 Installing from MELPA
=========================

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  If you haven’t used
Emacs’ package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by
reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see *note
(emacs)Packages::.  Then, add one of the archives to ‘package-archives’:

   • To use Melpa:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

   • To use Melpa-Stable:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

   Org-roam also depends on a recent version of Org, which can be
obtained in Org’s package repository (see *note (org)Installation::).

   Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its
dependencies using:

     M-x package-install RET org-roam RET


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Installing from Source,  Next: Installation Troubleshooting,  Prev: Installing from MELPA,  Up: Installation

4.2 Installing from Source
==========================

You may install Org-roam directly from the repository on GitHub
(https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) if you like.  This will give you
access to the latest version hours or days before it appears on MELPA,
and months (or more) before it is added to the Debian or Ubuntu
repositories.  This will also give you access to various developmental
branches that may be available.

   Note, however, that development version, and especially any feature
branches, may not always be in working order.  You’ll need to be
prepared to do some debugging, or to manually roll-back to working
versions, if you install from GitHub.

   Installing from GitHub requires that you clone the repository:

     git clone https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam.git /path/to/org/roam

   where ‘./path/to/org/roam’ is the location you will store your copy
of the code.

   Next, you need to add this location to your load path, and ‘require’
the Org-roam library.  Add the following code to your ‘.emacs’:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org/roam")
     (require 'org-roam)

   You now have Org-roam installed.  However, you don’t necessarily have
the dependencies that it requires.  These include:

   • dash

   • f

   • s

   • org

   • emacsql

   • emacsql-sqlite

   • magit-section

   You can install this manually as well, or get the latest version from
MELPA.  You may wish to use use-package
(https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), straight.el
(https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) to help manage this.

   If you would like to install the manual for access from Emacs’
built-in Info system, you’ll need to compile the .texi source file, and
install it in an appropriate location.

   To compile the .texi source file, from a terminal navigate to the
‘/doc’ subdirectory of the Org-roam repository, and run the following:

     make infodir=/path/to/my/info/files install-info

   Where ‘/path/to/my/info/files’ is the location where you keep info
files.  This target directory needs to be stored in the variable
‘Info-default-directory-list‘.  If you aren’t using one of the default
info locations, you can configure this with the following in your
‘.emacs’ file:

     (require 'info)
     (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list
                  "/path/to/my/info/files")

   You can also use one of the default locations, such as:

   • _usr/local/share/info_

   • _usr/share/info_

   • _usr/local/share/info_

   If you do this, you’ll need to make sure you have write-access to
that location, or run the above ‘make’ command as root.

   Now that the info file is ready, you need to add it to the
corresponding ‘dir’ file:

     install-info /path/to/my/info/files/org-roam.info /path/to/my/info/files/dir

4.3 Installation Troubleshooting
================================

* Menu:

* C Compiler::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: C Compiler,  Up: Installation Troubleshooting

4.3.1 C Compiler
----------------

Org-roam relies on an Emacs package called ‘emacsql’ and
‘emacsql-sqlite’ to work with the ‘sqlite’ database.  Both of them
should be installed automatically in your Emacs environment as a
prerequisite for Org-roam when you install it.

   ‘emacsql-sqlite’ requires a C compiler (e.g.  ‘gcc’ or ‘clang’) to be
present in your computer.  How to install a C compiler depends on the OS
that you use.

* Menu:

* C Compiler for Windows::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: C Compiler for Windows,  Up: C Compiler

C Compiler for Windows
......................

One of the easiest ways to install a C compiler in Windows is to use
MSYS2 (https://www.msys2.org/) as at the time of this writing:

   • Download and use the installer in the official MSYS2 website

   • Run MSYS2 and in its terminal, type the following and answer “Y” to
     proceed – this will install ‘gcc’ in your PC:

          pacman -S gcc

   • On Windows, add ‘C:\msys64\usr\bin’ (command ‘where gcc’ in MSYS2
     terminal can tell you the correct path) to ‘PATH’ in your
     environmental variables

   • Launch Emacs and call ‘M-x org-roam-db-autosync-mode’ (launch Emacs
     after defining the path, so that Emacs can recognize it)

   This will automatically start compiling ‘emacsql-sqlite’; you should
see a message in minibuffer.  It may take a while until compilation
completes.  Once complete, you should see a new file
‘emacsql-sqlite.exe’ created in a subfolder named ‘sqlite’ under
‘emacsql-sqlite’ installation folder.  It’s typically in your Emacs
configuration folder like this:
‘/.config/emacs/elpa/emacsql-sqlite-20190727.1710/sqlite’

5.1 The Org-roam Node
=====================

We first begin with some terminology we’ll use throughout the manual.
We term the basic denomination in Org-roam a node.  We define a node as
follows:

     A node is any headline or top level file with an ID.

   For example, with this example file content:

     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       foo
     :END:
     #+title: Foo

     * Bar
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       bar
     :END:

   We create two nodes:

   • A file node “Foo” with id ‘foo’.

   • A headline node “Bar” with id ‘bar’.

   Headlines without IDs will not be considered Org-roam nodes.  Org IDs
can be added to files or headlines via the interactive command ‘M-x
org-id-get-create’.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Links between Nodes,  Next: Setting up Org-roam,  Prev: The Org-roam Node,  Up: Getting Started

5.2 Links between Nodes
=======================

We link between nodes using Org’s standard ID link (e.g.  ‘id:foo’).
While only ID links will be considered during the computation of links
between nodes, Org-roam caches all other links in the documents for
external use.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Setting up Org-roam,  Next: Creating and Linking Nodes,  Prev: Links between Nodes,  Up: Getting Started

5.3 Setting up Org-roam
=======================

Org-roam’s capabilities stem from its aggressive caching: it crawls all
files within ‘org-roam-directory’, and maintains a cache of all links
and nodes.

   To start using Org-roam, pick a location to store the Org-roam files.
The directory that will contain your notes is specified by the variable
‘org-roam-directory’.  Org-roam searches recursively within
‘org-roam-directory’ for notes.  This variable needs to be set before
any calls to Org-roam functions.

   For this tutorial, create an empty directory, and set
‘org-roam-directory’:

     (make-directory "~/org-roam")
     (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/org-roam"))

   The ‘file-truename’ function is only necessary when you use symbolic
links inside ‘org-roam-directory’: Org-roam does not resolve symbolic
links.  One can however instruct Emacs to always resolve symlinks, at a
performance cost:

     (setq find-file-visit-truename t)

   Next, we setup Org-roam to run functions on file changes to maintain
cache consistency.  This is achieved by running ‘M-x
org-roam-db-autosync-mode’.  To ensure that Org-roam is available on
startup, place this in your Emacs configuration:

     (org-roam-db-autosync-mode)

   To build the cache manually, run ‘M-x org-roam-db-sync’.  Cache
builds may take a while the first time, but subsequent builds are often
instantaneous because they only reprocess modified files.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Creating and Linking Nodes,  Next: Customizing Node Completions,  Prev: Setting up Org-roam,  Up: Getting Started

5.4 Creating and Linking Nodes
==============================

Org-roam makes it easy to create notes and link them together.  There
are 2 main functions for creating nodes:

   • ‘org-roam-node-insert’: creates a node if it does not exist, and
     inserts a link to the node at point.

   • ‘org-roam-node-find’: creates a node if it does not exist, and
     visits the node.

   • ‘org-roam-capture’: creates a node if it does not exist, and
     restores the current window configuration upon completion.

   Let’s first try ‘org-roam-node-find’.  Calling ‘M-x
org-roam-node-find’ will show a list of titles for nodes that reside in
‘org-roam-directory’.  It should show nothing right now, since there are
no notes in the directory.  Enter the title of the note you wish to
create, and press ‘RET’.  This begins the note creation process.  This
process uses ‘org-capture’’s templating system, and can be customized
(see *note The Templating System::).  Using the default template,
pressing ‘C-c C-c’ finishes the note capture.

   Now that we have a node, we can try inserting a link to the node
using ‘M-x org-roam-node-insert’.  This brings up the list of nodes,
which should contain the node you just created.  Selecting the node will
insert an ‘id:’ link to the node.  If you instead entered a title that
does not exist, you will once again be brought through the node creation
process.

   One can also conveniently insert links via the completion-at-point
functions Org-roam provides (see *note Completion::).


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Customizing Node Completions,  Prev: Creating and Linking Nodes,  Up: Getting Started

5.5 Customizing Node Completions
================================

Node selection is achieved via the ‘completing-read’ interface,
typically through ‘org-roam-node-read‘.  The presentation of these nodes
are governed by ‘org-roam-node-display-template’.

 -- Variable: org-roam-node-display-template

     Configures display formatting for Org-roam node.

     Patterns of form “${field-name:length}” are interpolated based on
     the current node.

     Each “field-name” is replaced with the return value of each
     corresponding accessor function for org-roam-node, e.g.  “${title}”
     will be interpolated by the result of org-roam-node-title.  You can
     also define custom accessors using cl-defmethod.  For example, you
     can define:

     (cl-defmethod org-roam-node-my-title ((node org-roam-node)) (concat
     “My ” (org-roam-node-title node)))

     and then reference it here or in the capture templates as
     “${my-title}”.

     “length” is an optional specifier and declares how many characters
     can be used to display the value of the corresponding field.  If
     it’s not specified, the field will be inserted as is, i.e.  it
     won’t be aligned nor trimmed.  If it’s an integer, the field will
     be aligned accordingly and all the exceeding characters will be
     trimmed out.  If it’s “*”, the field will use as many characters as
     possible and will be aligned accordingly.

     A closure can also be assigned to this variable in which case the
     closure is evaluated and the return value is used as the template.
     The closure must evaluate to a valid template string.

   If you’re using a vertical completion framework, such as Ivy and
Selectrum, Org-roam supports the generation of an aligned, tabular
completion interface.  For example, to include a column for tags up to
10 character widths wide, one can set ‘org-roam-node-display-template’
as such:

     (setq org-roam-node-display-template
           (concat "${title:*} "
                   (propertize "${tags:10}" 'face 'org-tag)))

File: org-roam.info,  Node: How to cache,  Next: What to cache,  Up: Customizing Node Caching

6.1 How to cache
================

Org-roam uses a sqlite database to perform caching, but there are
multiple Emacs libraries that can be used.  The default used by Org-roam
is ‘emacs-sqlite’.  Below the pros and cons of each package is used:

   **emacs-sqlite** (https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql)

   The default option used by Org-roam.  This library is the most mature
and well-supported and is imported by default in Org-roam.

   One downside of using ‘emacs-sqlite’ is that using it requires
compilation and can cause issues in some environments (especially
Windows).  If you have issues producing the customized binary required
by ‘emacs-sqlite’, consider using ‘emacs-sqlite3’.

   **emacs-sqlite3** (https://github.com/cireu/emacsql-sqlite3)

   ‘emacs-sqlite3’ uses the official sqlite3 binary that can be obtained
from your system’s package manager.  This is useful if you have issues
producing the ‘sqlite3’ binary required by the other packages.  However,
it is not recommended because it has some compatibility issues with
Emacs, but should work for most regular cases.  See Chris Wellon’s blog
post (https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/02/06/) for more information.

   To use ‘emacsql-sqlite3’, ensure that the package is installed, and
set:

     (setq org-roam-database-connector 'sqlite3)

   **emacssql-sqlite-module**
(https://melpa.org/#/emacsql-sqlite-module) (previously
emacsql-libsqlite3)

   ‘emacs-sqlite-module’ is a relatively young package which uses an
Emacs module that exposes parts of the SQLite C API to Emacs Lisp,
instead of using subprocess as ‘emacsql-sqlite’ does.  It is expected to
be a more performant drop-in replacement for ‘emacs-sqlite’.

     (setq org-roam-database-connector 'sqlite-module)

   **emacsql-sqlite-builtin**
(https://melpa.org/#/emacsql-sqlite-builtin)

   ‘emacsql-sqlite-builtin’ uses the in-built SQLite support for Emacs
29 and later.  This is the recommended option if you are using a version
of Emacs that supports it.

6.2 What to cache
=================

By default, all nodes (any headline or file with an ID) are cached by
Org-roam.  There are instances where you may want to have headlines with
ID, but not have them cached by Org-roam.

   To exclude a headline from the Org-roam database, set the
‘ROAM_EXCLUDE’ property to a non-nil value.  For example:

     * Foo
       :PROPERTIES:
       :ID:       foo
       :ROAM_EXCLUDE: t
       :END:

   One can also set ‘org-roam-db-node-include-function’.  For example,
to exclude all headlines with the ‘ATTACH’ tag from the Org-roam
database, one can set:

     (setq org-roam-db-node-include-function
           (lambda ()
             (not (member "ATTACH" (org-get-tags)))))

   Org-roam relied on the obtained Org AST for the buffer to parse
links.  However, links appearing in some places (e.g.  within property
drawers) are not considered by the Org AST to be links.  Therefore,
Org-roam takes special care of additionally trying to process these
links.  Use ‘org-roam-db-extra-links-elements’ to specify which
additional Org AST element types to consider.

 -- Variable: org-roam-db-extra-links-elements

     The list of Org element types to include for parsing by Org-roam.

     By default, when parsing Org’s AST, links within keywords and
     property drawers are not parsed as links.  Sometimes however, it is
     desirable to parse and cache these links (e.g.  hiding links in a
     property drawer).

   Additionally, one may want to ignore certain keys from being excluded
within property drawers.  For example, we would not want ‘ROAM_REFS’
links to be self-referential.  Hence, to exclude specific keys, we use
‘org-roam-db-extra-links-exclude-keys’.

 -- Variable: org-roam-db-extra-links-exclude-keys

     Keys to ignore when mapping over links.

     The car of the association list is the Org element type (e.g.
     keyword).  The cdr is a list of case-insensitive strings to exclude
     from being treated as links.

6.3 When to cache
=================

By default, Org-roam is eager in caching: each time an Org-roam file is
modified and saved, it updates the database for the corresponding file.
This keeps the database up-to-date, causing the least surprise when
using the interactive commands.

   However, depending on how large your Org files are, database updating
can be a slow operation.  You can disable the automatic updating of the
database by setting ‘org-roam-db-update-on-save’ to ‘nil’.

 -- Variable: org-roam-db-update-on-save

   If t, update the Org-roam database upon saving the file.  Disable
this if your files are large and updating the database is slow.

7 The Org-roam Buffer
*********************

Org-roam provides the Org-roam buffer: an interface to view
relationships with other notes (backlinks, reference links, unlinked
references etc.).  There are two main commands to use here:

   • ‘org-roam-buffer-toggle’: Launch an Org-roam buffer that tracks the
     node currently at point.  This means that the content of the buffer
     changes as the point is moved, if necessary.

   • ‘org-roam-buffer-display-dedicated’: Launch an Org-roam buffer for
     a specific node without visiting its file.  Unlike
     ‘org-roam-buffer-toggle’ you can have multiple such buffers and
     their content won’t be automatically replaced with a new node at
     point.

   To bring up a buffer that tracks the current node at point, call ‘M-x
org-roam-buffer-toggle’.

 -- Function: org-roam-buffer-toggle

     Toggle display of the ‘org-roam-buffer’.

   To bring up a buffer that’s dedicated for a specific node, call ‘M-x
org-roam-buffer-display-dedicated’.

 -- Function: org-roam-buffer-display-dedicated

     Launch node dedicated Org-roam buffer without visiting the node
     itself.

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Navigating the Org-roam Buffer,  Next: Configuring what is displayed in the buffer,  Up: The Org-roam Buffer

7.1 Navigating the Org-roam Buffer
==================================

The Org-roam buffer uses ‘magit-section’, making the typical
‘magit-section’ keybindings available.  Here are several of the more
useful ones:

   • ‘M-{N}’: ‘magit-section-show-level-{N}-all’

   • ‘n’: ‘magit-section-forward’

   • ‘<TAB>’: ‘magit-section-toggle’

   • ‘<RET>’: ‘org-roam-buffer-visit-thing’

   ‘org-roam-buffer-visit-thing’ is a placeholder command, that is
replaced by section-specific commands such as ‘org-roam-node-visit’.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Configuring what is displayed in the buffer,  Next: Configuring the Org-roam buffer display,  Prev: Navigating the Org-roam Buffer,  Up: The Org-roam Buffer

7.2 Configuring what is displayed in the buffer
===============================================

There are currently 3 provided widget types:

   • BacklinksView (preview of) nodes that link to this node

   • Reference LinksNodes that reference this node (see *note Refs::)

   • Unlinked referencesView nodes that contain text that match the
     nodes title/alias but are not linked

   To configure what sections are displayed in the buffer, set
~org-roam-mode-sections.

     (setq org-roam-mode-sections
           (list #'org-roam-backlinks-section
                 #'org-roam-reflinks-section
                 ;; #'org-roam-unlinked-references-section
                 ))

   Note that computing unlinked references may be slow, and has not been
added in by default.

   For each section function, you can pass args along to modify its
behaviour.  For example, if you want to render unique sources for
backlinks (and also keep rendering reference links), set
‘org-roam-mode-sections’ as follows:

     (setq org-roam-mode-sections
           '((org-roam-backlinks-section :unique t)
             org-roam-reflinks-section))

7.3 Configuring the Org-roam buffer display
===========================================

Org-roam does not control how the pop-up buffer is displayed: this is
left to the user.  The author’s recommended configuration is as follows:

     (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
                  '("\\*org-roam\\*"
                    (display-buffer-in-direction)
                    (direction . right)
                    (window-width . 0.33)
                    (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer)))

   Crucially, the window is a regular window (not a side-window), and
this allows for predictable navigation:

   • ‘RET’ navigates to thing-at-point in the current window, replacing
     the Org-roam buffer.

   • ‘C-u RET’ navigates to thing-at-point in the other window.

   For users that prefer using a side-window for the org-roam buffer,
the following example configuration should provide a good starting
point:

     (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
                  '("\\*org-roam\\*"
                    (display-buffer-in-side-window)
                    (side . right)
                    (slot . 0)
                    (window-width . 0.33)
                    (window-parameters . ((no-other-window . t)
                                          (no-delete-other-windows . t)))))

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Standard Org properties,  Next: Titles and Aliases,  Up: Node Properties

8.1 Standard Org properties
===========================

Org-roam caches most of the standard Org properties.  The full list now
includes:

   • outline level

   • todo state

   • priority

   • scheduled

   • deadline

   • tags


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Titles and Aliases,  Next: Tags,  Prev: Standard Org properties,  Up: Node Properties

8.2 Titles and Aliases
======================

Each node has a single title.  For file nodes, this is specified with
the ‘#+title‘ property for the file.  For headline nodes, this is the
main text.

   Nodes can also have multiple aliases.  Aliases allow searching for
nodes via an alternative name.  For example, one may want to assign a
well-known acronym (AI) to a node titled “Artificial Intelligence”.

   To assign an alias to a node, add the “ROAM_ALIASES” property to the
node:

     * Artificial Intelligence
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ROAM_ALIASES: AI
     :END:

   Alternatively, Org-roam provides some functions to add or remove
aliases.

 -- Function: org-roam-alias-add alias

     Add ALIAS to the node at point.  When called interactively, prompt
     for the alias to add.

 -- Function: org-roam-alias-remove

     Remove an alias from the node at point.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Tags,  Next: Refs,  Prev: Titles and Aliases,  Up: Node Properties

8.3 Tags
========

Tags for top-level (file) nodes are pulled from the variable
‘org-file-tags’, which is set by the ‘#+filetags’ keyword, as well as
other tags the file may have inherited.  Tags for headline level nodes
are regular Org tags.

   Note that the ‘#+filetags’ keyword results in tags being inherited by
headers within the file.  This makes it impossible for selective tag
inheritance: i.e.  either tag inheritance is turned off, or all headline
nodes will inherit the tags from the file node.  This is a design
compromise of Org-roam.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Refs,  Prev: Tags,  Up: Node Properties

8.4 Refs
========

Refs are unique identifiers for nodes.  These keys allow references to
the key to show up in the Org-roam buffer.  For example, a node for a
website may use the URL as the ref, and a node for a paper may use an
Org-ref citation key.

   To add a ref, add to the “ROAM_REFS” property as follows:

     * Google
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ROAM_REFS: https://www.google.com/
     :END:

   With the above example, if another node links to
<https://www.google.com/>, it will show up as a “reference backlink”.

   These keys also come in useful for when taking website notes, using
the ‘roam-ref’ protocol (see *note org-roam-protocol::).

   You may assign multiple refs to a single node, for example when you
want multiple papers in a series to share the same note, or an article
has a citation key and a URL at the same time.

   Org-roam also provides some functions to add or remove refs.

 -- Function: org-roam-ref-add ref

     Add REF to the node at point.  When called interactively, prompt
     for the ref to add.

 -- Function: org-roam-ref-remove

     Remove a ref from the node at point.

9 Citations
***********

Since version 9.5, Org has first-class support for citations.  Org-roam
supports the caching of both these in-built citations (of form
‘[cite:@key]’) and org-ref (https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref)
citations (of form cite:key).

   Org-roam attempts to load both the ‘org-ref’ and ‘org-cite’ package
when indexing files, so no further setup from the user is required for
citation support.

* Menu:

* Using the Cached Information::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Using the Cached Information,  Up: Citations

9.1 Using the Cached Information
================================

It is common to use take reference notes for academic papers.  To
designate the node to be the canonical node for the academic paper, we
can use its unique citation key:

     * Probabilistic Robotics
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       51b7b82c-bbb4-4822-875a-ed548cffda10
     :ROAM_REFS: @thrun2005probabilistic
     :END:

   or

     * Probabilistic Robotics
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       51b7b82c-bbb4-4822-875a-ed548cffda10
     :ROAM_REFS: [cite:@thrun2005probabilistic]
     :END:

   for ‘org-cite’, or:

     * Probabilistic Robotics
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       51b7b82c-bbb4-4822-875a-ed548cffda10
     :ROAM_REFS: cite:thrun2005probabilistic
     :END:

   for ‘org-ref’.

   When another node has a citation for that key, we can see it using
the ‘Reflinks’ section of the Org-roam buffer.

   Extension developers may be interested in retrieving the citations
within their notes.  This information can be found within the ‘citation’
table of the Org-roam database.

10 Completion
*************

Completions for Org-roam are provided via ‘completion-at-point’.
Org-roam currently provides completions in two scenarios:

   • When within an Org bracket link

   • Anywhere

   Completions are installed locally in all Org-roam files.  To trigger
completions, call ‘M-x completion-at-point’.  If using ‘company-mode’,
add ‘company-capf’ to ‘company-backends’.

   Completions respect ‘completion-styles’: the user is free to choose
how candidates are matched.  An example of a completion style that has
grown in popularity is orderless
(https://github.com/oantolin/orderless).

10.1 Completing within Link Brackets
====================================

Completions within link brackets are provided by
‘org-roam-complete-link-at-point’.

   The completion candidates are the titles and aliases for all Org-roam
nodes.  Upon choosing a candidate, a ‘roam:Title’ link will be inserted,
linking to node of choice.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Completing anywhere,  Prev: Completing within Link Brackets,  Up: Completion

10.2 Completing anywhere
========================

The same completions can be triggered anywhere for the symbol at point
if not within a bracketed link.  This is provided by
‘org-roam-complete-everywhere’.  Similarly, the completion candidates
are the titles and aliases for all Org-roam nodes, and upon choosing a
candidate a ‘roam:Title’ link will be inserted linking to the node of
choice.

   This is disable by default.  To enable it, set
‘org-roam-completion-everywhere’ to ‘t’:

     (setq org-roam-completion-everywhere t)

 -- Variable: org-roam-completion-everywhere

   When non-nil, provide link completion matching outside of Org links.

11 Encryption
*************

Emacs has support for creating and editing encrypted gpg files, and
Org-roam need not provide additional tooling.  To create encrypted
files, simply add the ‘.gpg’ extension in your Org-roam capture
templates.  For example:

     (setq org-roam-capture-templates '(("d" "default" plain "%?"
          :target (file+head "${slug}.org.gpg"
                             "#+title: ${title}\n")
          :unnarrowed t)))

   Note that the Org-roam database stores metadata information in
plain-text (headline text, for example), so if this information is
private to you then you should also ensure the database is encrypted.

12 The Templating System
************************

Org-roam extends the ‘org-capture’ system, providing a smoother
note-taking experience.  However, these extensions mean Org-roam capture
templates are incompatible with ‘org-capture’ templates.

   Org-roam’s templates are specified by ‘org-roam-capture-templates’.
Just like ‘org-capture-templates’, ‘org-roam-capture-templates’ can
contain multiple templates.  If ‘org-roam-capture-templates’ only
contains one template, there will be no prompt for template selection.

* Menu:

* Template Walkthrough::
* Org-roam Template Expansion::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Template Walkthrough,  Next: Org-roam Template Expansion,  Up: The Templating System

12.1 Template Walkthrough
=========================

To demonstrate the additions made to org-capture templates.  Here, we
explain the default template, reproduced below.  You will find most of
the elements of the template are similar to ‘org-capture’ templates.

     (("d" "default" plain "%?"
       :target (file+head "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}.org"
                          "#+title: ${title}\n")
       :unnarrowed t))

   • The template has short key ‘"d"’.  If you have only one template,
     org-roam automatically chooses this template for you.

   • The template is given a description of ‘"default"’.

   • ‘plain’ text is inserted.  Other options include Org headings via
     ‘entry’.

   • Notice that the ‘target’ that’s usually in Org-capture templates is
     missing here.

   • ‘"%?"’ is the template inserted on each call to
     ‘org-roam-capture-’.  This template means don’t insert any content,
     but place the cursor here.

   • ‘:target’ is a compulsory specification in the Org-roam capture
     template.  The first element of the list indicates the type of the
     target, the second element indicates the location of the captured
     node, and the rest of the elements indicate prefilled template that
     will be inserted and the position of the point will be adjusted
     for.  The latter behavior varies from type to type of the capture
     target.

   • ‘:unnarrowed t’ tells org-capture to show the contents for the
     whole file, rather than narrowing to just the entry.  This is part
     of the Org-capture templates.

   See the ‘org-roam-capture-templates’ documentation for more details
and customization options.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Org-roam Template Expansion,  Prev: Template Walkthrough,  Up: The Templating System

12.2 Org-roam Template Expansion
================================

Org-roam’s template definitions also extend org-capture’s template
syntax, to allow prefilling of strings.  We have seen a glimpse of this
in *note Template Walkthrough: Template Walkthrough.

   Org-roam provides the ‘${foo}’ syntax for substituting variables with
known strings.  ‘${foo}’’s substitution is performed as follows:

   • If ‘foo’ is a function, ‘foo’ is called with the current node as
     its argument.

   • Else if ‘org-roam-node-foo’ is a function, ‘foo’ is called with the
     current node as its argument.  The ‘org-roam-node-’ prefix defines
     many of Org-roam’s node accessors such as ‘org-roam-node-title’ and
     ‘org-roam-node-level’.

   • Else look up ‘org-roam-capture--info’ for ‘foo’.  This is an
     internal variable that is set before the capture process begins.

   • If none of the above applies, read a string using
     ‘completing-read’.
        • Org-roam also provides the ‘${foo=default_val}’ syntax, where
          if a default value is provided, will be the initial value for
          the ‘foo’ key during minibuffer completion.

   One can check the list of available keys for nodes by inspecting the
‘org-roam-node’ struct.  At the time of writing, it is:

     (cl-defstruct (org-roam-node (:constructor org-roam-node-create)
                                  (:copier nil))
       "A heading or top level file with an assigned ID property."
       file file-hash file-atime file-mtime
       id level point todo priority scheduled deadline title properties olp
       tags aliases refs)

   This makes ‘${file}’, ‘${file-hash}’ etc.  all valid substitutions.

-------------------

To enable Org-roam’s protocol extensions, simply add the following to
your init file:

     (require 'org-roam-protocol)

   We also need to set up ‘org-protocol’: the instructions for setting
up ‘org-protocol’ are reproduced here.

   On a high-level, external calls are passed to Emacs via
‘emacsclient’.  ‘org-protocol’ intercepts these and runs custom actions
based on the protocols registered.  Hence, to use ‘org-protocol’, once
must:

   • launch the ‘emacsclient’ process

   • Register ‘org-protocol://’ as a valid scheme-handler

   The instructions for the latter for each operating system is detailed
below.

* Menu:

* Linux::
* Mac OS::

     Exec=emacsclient %u
     Icon=emacs-icon
     Type=Application
     Terminal=false

   Associate ‘org-protocol://’ links with the desktop application by
running in your shell:

     xdg-mime default org-protocol.desktop x-scheme-handler/org-protocol

   To disable the “confirm” prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the ‘Org-Protocol Client’ app will be
used without confirmation.  To do this, run in a shell:

     sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/
     sudo tee /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
     {

     }
     EOF
     sudo chmod 644 /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json

   and then restart Chrome (for example, by navigating to
<chrome://restart>) to make the new policy take effect.

   • Save the script in ‘/Applications/OrgProtocolClient.app’, changing
     the script type to “Application”, rather than “Script”.

   • Edit ‘/Applications/OrgProtocolClient.app/Contents/Info.plist’,
     adding the following before the last ‘</dict>’ tag:

     <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
     <array>
       <dict>
         <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
         <string>org-protocol handler</string>
         <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
         <array>
           <string>org-protocol</string>
         </array>
       </dict>
     </array>

   • Save the file, and run the ‘OrgProtocolClient.app’ to register the
     protocol.

   To disable the “confirm” prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the ‘OrgProtocol’ app will be used
without confirmation.  To do this, run in a shell:

     defaults write com.google.Chrome ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox -bool true

   If you’re using Emacs Mac Port
(https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport), it registered its
‘Emacs.app‘ as the default handler for the URL scheme ‘org-protocol‘.
To make ‘OrgProtocol.app’ the default handler instead, run:

     defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \
     '{"LSHandlerPreferredVersions" = { "LSHandlerRoleAll" = "-"; }; LSHandlerRoleAll = "org.yourusername.OrgProtocol"; LSHandlerURLScheme = "org-protocol";}'

   Then restart your computer.

   • Testing org-protocol

     To test that you have the handler setup and registered properly
     from the command line you can run:

          open org-protocol://roam-ref\?template=r\&ref=test\&title=this

     If you get an error similar too this or the wrong handler is run:

          No application knows how to open URL
          org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref=test&title=this (Error
          Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-10814
          “kLSApplicationNotFoundErr: E.g.  no application claims the
          file” UserInfo={_LSLine=1489, _LSFunction=runEvaluator}).

     You may need to manually register your handler, like this:

          /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -R  -f /Applications/OrgProtocolClient.app

     Here is a link to the lsregister command that is really useful:

For Windows, create a temporary ‘org-protocol.reg’ file:

     REGEDIT4

     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol]
     @="URL:Org Protocol"
     "URL Protocol"=""
     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell]

     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open\command]
     @="\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe\" emacsclient \"%1\""

   The above will forward the protocol to WSL.  If you run Emacs
natively on Windows, replace the last line with:

     @="\"c:\\path\\to\\emacs\\bin\\emacsclientw.exe\"  \"%1\""

   After executing the .reg file, the protocol is registered and you can
delete the file.

13.1.2 The roam-node protocol
-----------------------------

The roam-node protocol opens the node with ID specified by the ‘node’
key (e.g.  ‘org-protocol://roam-node?node=node-id’).  ‘org-roam-graph’
uses this to make the graph navigable.

This protocol finds or creates a new note with a given ‘ROAM_REFS’:

 [image src="images/roam-ref.gif" ]

   To use this, create the following bookmarklet
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) in your browser:

     javascript:location.href =

13.2 org-roam-graph
===================

Org-roam provides basic graphing capabilities to explore
interconnections between notes, in ‘org-roam-graph’.  This is done by
performing SQL queries and generating images using Graphviz
(https://graphviz.org/).  The graph can also be navigated: see *note
org-roam-protocol::.

   The entry point to graph creation is ‘org-roam-graph’.

 -- Function: org-roam-graph & optional arg node

   Build and display a graph for NODE.  ARG may be any of the following
values:

   • ‘nil’ show the full graph.

   • ‘integer’ an integer argument ‘N’ will show the graph for the
     connected components to node up to ‘N’ steps away.
 -- User Option: org-roam-graph-executable

     Path to the graphing executable (in this case, Graphviz).  Set this
     if Org-roam is unable to find the Graphviz executable on your
     system.

     You may also choose to use ‘neato’ in place of ‘dot’, which
     generates a more compact graph layout.

 -- User Option: org-roam-graph-viewer

     Org-roam defaults to using Firefox (located on PATH) to view the
     SVG, but you may choose to set it to:

        • A string, which is a path to the program used

        • a function accepting a single argument: the graph file path.

     ‘nil’ uses ‘view-file’ to view the graph.

     If you are using WSL2 and would like to open the graph in Windows,
     you can use the second option to set the browser and network file
     path:

          (setq org-roam-graph-viewer
              (lambda (file)
                (let ((org-roam-graph-viewer "/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe"))
                  (org-roam-graph--open (concat "file://///wsl$/Ubuntu" file)))))

13.2.1 Graph Options
--------------------

Graphviz provides many options for customizing the graph output, and
Org-roam supports some of them.  See
<https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/attrs.html> for customizable
options.

 -- User Option: org-roam-graph-filetype

     The file type to generate for graphs.  This defaults to ‘"svg"’.

 -- User Option: org-roam-graph-extra-config

     Extra options passed to graphviz for the digraph (The “G”
     attributes).  Example: ‘'~(("rankdir" . "LR"))’

 -- User Option: org-roam-graph-node-extra-config

     An alist of options to style the nodes.  The car of the alist node
     type such as ‘"id"’, or ‘"http"’.  The cdr of the list is another
     alist of Graphviz node options (the “N” attributes).

 -- User Option: org-roam-graph-edge-extra-config

     Extra options for edges in the graphviz output (The “E”
     attributes).  Example: ‘'(("dir" . "back"))’

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Usage,  Up: org-roam-dailies

13.3.1 Configuration
--------------------

For ‘org-roam-dailies’ to work, you need to define two variables:

 -- Variable: ‘org-roam-dailies-directory’

     Path to daily-notes.  This path is relative to
     ‘org-roam-directory’.

 -- Variable: ‘org-roam-dailies-capture-templates’

     Capture templates for daily-notes in Org-roam.

   Here is a sane default configuration:

     (setq org-roam-dailies-directory "daily/")

     (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
           '(("d" "default" entry
              "* %?"
              :target (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org"
                                 "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"))))

   See *note The Templating System:: for creating new templates.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Usage,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: org-roam-dailies

13.3.2 Usage
------------

‘org-roam-dailies’ provides these interactive functions:

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-capture-today’ &optional goto

     Create an entry in the daily note for today.

     When ‘goto’ is non-nil, go to the note without creating an entry.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-goto-today’

     Find the daily note for today, creating it if necessary.

   There are variants of those commands for ‘-yesterday’ and
‘-tomorrow’:

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday’ n &optional goto

     Create an entry in the daily note for yesterday.

     With numeric argument ‘n’, use the daily note ‘n’ days in the past.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-goto-yesterday’

     With numeric argument N, use the daily-note N days in the future.

   There are also commands which allow you to use Emacs’s ‘calendar’ to
find the date

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-capture-date’

     Create an entry in the daily note for a date using the calendar.

     Prefer past dates, unless ‘prefer-future’ is non-nil.

     With a ’C-u’ prefix or when ‘goto’ is non-nil, go the note without
     creating an entry.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-goto-date’

     Find the daily note for a date using the calendar, creating it if
     necessary.

     Prefer past dates, unless ‘prefer-future’ is non-nil.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-find-directory’

     Find and open ‘org-roam-dailies-directory’.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-goto-previous-note’

     When in an daily-note, find the previous one.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-goto-next-note’

     When in an daily-note, find the next one.

13.4 org-roam-export
====================

Because Org-roam files are plain org files, they can be exported easily
using ‘org-export’ to a variety of formats, including ‘html’ and ‘pdf’.
However, Org-roam relies heavily on ID links, which Org’s html export
has poor support of.  To fix this, Org-roam provides a bunch of
overrides to better support export.  To use them, simply run:

     (require 'org-roam-export)

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Garbage Collection,  Up: Performance Optimization

14.1 Garbage Collection
=======================

During the cache-build process, Org-roam generates a lot of in-memory
data-structures (such as the Org file’s AST), which are discarded after
use.  These structures are garbage collected at regular intervals (see
*note info:elisp#Garbage Collection: (elisp)Garbage Collection.).

   Org-roam provides the option ‘org-roam-db-gc-threshold’ to
temporarily change the threshold value for GC to be triggered during
these memory-intensive operations.  To reduce the number of garbage
collection processes, one may set ‘org-roam-db-gc-threshold’ to a high
value (such as ‘most-positive-fixnum’):

     (setq org-roam-db-gc-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

15.1 Browsing History with winner-mode
======================================

‘winner-mode’ is a global minor mode that allows one to undo and redo
changes in the window configuration.  It is included with GNU Emacs
since version 20.

   ‘winner-mode’ can be used as a simple version of browser history for
Org-roam.  Each click through org-roam links (from both Org files and
the backlinks buffer) causes changes in window configuration, which can
be undone and redone using ‘winner-mode’.  To use ‘winner-mode’, simply
enable it, and bind the appropriate interactive functions:

     (winner-mode +1)
     (define-key winner-mode-map (kbd "<M-left>") #'winner-undo)
     (define-key winner-mode-map (kbd "<M-right>") #'winner-redo)

15.2 Versioning Notes
=====================

Since Org-roam notes are just plain text, it is trivial to track changes
in your notes database using version control systems such as Git
(https://git-scm.com/).  Simply initialize ‘org-roam-directory’ as a Git
repository, and commit your files at regular or appropriate intervals.
Magit (https://magit.vc/) is a great interface to Git within Emacs.

   In addition, it may be useful to observe how a particular note has
evolved, by looking at the file history.  Git-timemachine
(https://gitlab.com/pidu/git-timemachine) allows you to visit historic
versions of a tracked Org-roam note.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Full-text search with Deft,  Next: Org-journal,  Prev: Versioning Notes,  Up: The Org-mode Ecosystem

15.3 Full-text search with Deft
===============================

Deft (https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) provides a nice interface for
browsing and filtering org-roam notes.

     (use-package deft
       :after org
       :bind
       ("C-c n d" . deft)
       :custom
       (deft-recursive t)
       (deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
       (deft-default-extension "org")
       (deft-directory org-roam-directory))

   The Deft interface can slow down quickly when the number of files get
huge.  Notdeft (https://github.com/hasu/notdeft) is a fork of Deft that
uses an external search engine and indexer.

capabilities to Org-mode.  A lot of its functionalities have been
incorporated into Org-roam under the name *note ‘org-roam-dailies’:
org-roam-dailies.  It remains a good tool if you want to isolate your
verbose journal entries from the ideas you would write on a scratchpad.

     (use-package org-journal

Org 9.5 added native citation and bibliography functionality, called
“org-cite”, which org-roam supports.

   org-roam-bibtex (https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex) offers
tight integration between org-ref (https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref),
helm-bibtex (https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex) and ‘org-roam’.
This helps you manage your bibliographic notes under ‘org-roam’.

   For example, though helm-bibtex provides the ability to visit notes
for bibliographic entries, org-roam-bibtex extends it with the ability
to visit the file with the right ‘ROAM_REFS’.

(https://github.com/abo-abo/pamparam).

   To use Anki for spaced repetition, anki-editor
(https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor) allows you to write your cards
in Org-mode, and sync your cards to Anki via anki-connect
(https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect#installation).

16.1 How do I have more than one Org-roam directory?
====================================================

Emacs supports directory-local variables, allowing the value of
‘org-roam-directory’ to be different in different directories.  It does
this by checking for a file named ‘.dir-locals.el’.

   To add support for multiple directories, override the
‘org-roam-directory’ variable using directory-local variables.  This is
what ‘.dir-locals.el’ may contain:

     ((nil . ((org-roam-directory . "/path/to/alt/org-roam-dir")
              (org-roam-db-location . "/path/to/alt/org-roam-dir/org-roam.db"))))

   Note ‘org-roam-directory’ and ‘org-roam-db-location’ should be an
absolute path, not relative.

   Alternatively, use ‘eval’ if you wish to call functions:

     ((nil . ((eval . (setq-local
                       org-roam-directory (expand-file-name (locate-dominating-file
                                                             default-directory ".dir-locals.el"))))
              (eval . (setq-local
                       org-roam-db-location (expand-file-name "org-roam.db"
                                                              org-roam-directory))))))

   All files within that directory will be treated as their own separate
set of Org-roam files.  Remember to run ‘org-roam-db-sync’ from a file
within that directory, at least once.

16.2 How do I create a note whose title already matches one of the candidates?
==============================================================================

This situation arises when, for example, one would like to create a note
titled “bar” when “barricade” already exists.

   The solution is dependent on the mini-buffer completion framework in
use.  Here are the solutions:

   • Ivycall ‘ivy-immediate-done’, typically bound to ‘C-M-j’.
     Alternatively, set ‘ivy-use-selectable-prompt’ to ‘t’, so that
     “bar” is now selectable.

   • HelmOrg-roam should provide a selectable “[?]  bar” candidate at
     the top of the candidate list.

16.3 How can I stop Org-roam from creating IDs everywhere?
==========================================================

Other than the interactive commands that Org-roam provides, Org-roam
does not create IDs everywhere.  If you are noticing that IDs are being
created even when you don’t want them to be (e.g.  when tangling an Org
file), check the value you have set for ‘org-id-link-to-org-use-id’:
setting it to ‘'create-if-interactive’ is a popular option.

16.5 How to migrate from Org-roam v1?
=====================================

Those coming from Org-roam v1 will do well treating v2 as entirely new
software.  V2 has a smaller core and fewer moving parts, while retaining
the bulk of its functionality.  It is recommended to read the
documentation above about nodes.

   It is still desirable to migrate notes collected in v1 to v2.  To
migrate your v1 notes to v2, use ‘M-x org-roam-migrate-wizard’.  This

(https://d12frosted.io/posts/2021-06-11-path-to-org-roam-v2.html)
provides a good overview of what’s new in v2 and how to migrate.

   Essentially, to migrate notes from v1 to v2, one must:

   • Add IDs to all existing notes.  These are located in top-level
     property drawers (Although note that in v2, not all files need to
     have IDs).

   • Update the Org-roam database to conform to the new schema.

   • Replace ‘#+ROAM_KEY’ into the ‘ROAM_REFS’ property

   • Replace ‘#+ROAM_ALIAS’ into the ‘ROAM_ALIASES’ property

   • Move ‘#+ROAM_TAGS’ into the ‘#+FILETAGS’ property for file-level
     nodes, and the ‘ROAM_TAGS’ property for headline nodes

   • Replace existing file links with ID links.

16.6 How do I publish my notes with an Internet-friendly graph?
===============================================================

The default graph builder creates a graph with an org-protocol
(https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html) handler which
is convenient when you’re working locally but inconvenient when you want
to publish your notes for remote access.  Likewise, it defaults to
displaying the graph in Emacs which has the exact same caveats.  This
problem is solvable in the following way using org-mode’s native
publishing (https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html) capability:

   • configure org-mode to publish your org-roam notes as a project.

   • create a function that overrides the default org-protocol link
     creation function(‘org-roam-default-link-builder’).

   • create a hook that’s called at the end of graph creation to copy
     the generated graph to the appropriate place.

   The example code below is used to publish to a local directory where
a separate shell script copies the files to the remote site.

16.6.1 Configure org-mode for publishing
----------------------------------------

This has two steps:
   • Setting of a _roam_ project that publishes your notes.

   • Configuring the _sitemap.html_ generation.

   • Setting up ‘org-publish’ to generate the graph.

   This will require code like the following:
     (defun roam-sitemap (title list)
       (concat "#+OPTIONS: ^:nil author:nil html-postamble:nil\n"
               "#+SETUPFILE: ./simple_inline.theme\n"
               "#+TITLE: " title "\n\n"
               (org-list-to-org list) "\nfile:sitemap.svg"))

     (setq my-publish-time 0)   ; see the next section for context
     (defun roam-publication-wrapper (plist filename pubdir)
       (org-roam-graph)
       (org-html-publish-to-html plist filename pubdir)
       (setq my-publish-time (cadr (current-time))))

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
       '(("roam"
          :base-directory "~/roam"
          :auto-sitemap t
          :sitemap-function roam-sitemap
          :sitemap-title "Roam notes"
          :publishing-function roam-publication-wrapper
          :publishing-directory "~/roam-export"
          :section-number nil
          :table-of-contents nil
          :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../other/mystyle.cs\" type=\"text/css\">")))

16.6.2 Overriding the default link creation function
----------------------------------------------------

The code below will generate a link to the generated html file instead
of the default org-protocol link.
     (defun org-roam-custom-link-builder (node)
       (let ((file (org-roam-node-file node)))
         (concat (file-name-base file) ".html")))

     (setq org-roam-graph-link-builder 'org-roam-custom-link-builder)


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Copying the generated file to the export directory,  Prev: Overriding the default link creation function,  Up: How do I publish my notes with an Internet-friendly graph?

16.6.3 Copying the generated file to the export directory
---------------------------------------------------------

The default behavior of ‘org-roam-graph’ is to generate the graph and
display it in Emacs.  There is an ‘org-roam-graph-generation-hook’
available that provides access to the file names so they can be copied
to the publishing directory.  Example code follows:

     (add-hook 'org-roam-graph-generation-hook
               (lambda (dot svg) (if (< (- (cadr (current-time)) my-publish-time) 5)
                                     (progn (copy-file svg "~/roam-export/sitemap.svg" 't)
                                            (kill-buffer (file-name-nondirectory svg))
                                            (setq my-publish-time 0)))))

16.7 I’m seeing this “Selecting deleted buffer” error. What do I do?
====================================================================

The “selecting deleted buffer” error usually occurs when you don’t have
a working ‘emacsql-sqlite’ executable.  Org-roam relies on this
executable to function properly, and doesn’t catch this error.  This
issue is most commonly seen on Windows setups.  You can browse through
the various GitHub issues posted about this here
(https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues?q=is%3Aissue+selecting+deleted).

   To fix this, you can try the following:

   • If on Windows, try replacing your system binary with this one
     (https://github.com/nobiot/emacsql-sqlite.exe) that has been proven
     to work

   • Use the ‘emacsql-sqlite3’ option rather than compiling your own
     emacsql binary (see *note How to cache::).

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Org-roam's Design Principle,  Next: Building Extensions and Advanced Customization of Org-roam,  Up: Developer's Guide to Org-roam

17.1 Org-roam’s Design Principle
================================

Org-roam is primarily motivated by the need for a dual representation.
We (humans) love operating in a plain-text environment.  The syntax
rules of Org-mode are simple and fit snugly within our brain.  This also
allows us to use the tools and packages we love to explore and edit our
notes.  Org-mode is simply the most powerful plain-text format
available, with support for images, LaTeX, TODO planning and much more.

   But this plain-text format is simply ill-suited for exploration of
these notes: plain-text is simply not amenable for answering
large-scale, complex queries (e.g.  how many tasks do I have that are
due by next week?).  Interfaces such as Org-agenda slow to a crawl when
the number of files becomes unwieldy, which can quickly become the case.

   At its core, Org-roam provides a database abstraction layer,
providing a dual representation of what’s already available in
plain-text.  This allows us (humans) to continue working with
plain-text, while programs can utilize the database layer to perform
complex queries.  These capabilities include, but are not limited to:

   • link graph traversal and visualization

   • Instantaneous SQL-like queries on headlines
        • What are my TODOs, scheduled for X, or due by Y?

   • Accessing the properties of a node, such as its tags, refs, TODO
     state or priority

   All of these functionality is powered by this database abstraction
layer.  Hence, at its core Org-roam’s primary goal is to provide a
resilient dual representation that is cheap to maintain, easy to
understand, and is as up-to-date as it possibly can.  Org-roam also then
exposes an API to this database abstraction layer for users who would
like to perform programmatic queries on their Org files.

17.2 Building Extensions and Advanced Customization of Org-roam
===============================================================

Because Org-roam’s core functionality is small, it is possible and
sometimes desirable to build extensions on top of it.  These extensions
may one or more of the following functionalities:

   • Access to Org-roam’s database

   • Usage/modification of Org-roam’s interactive commands

   Org-roam provides no guarantees that extensions will continue to
function as Org-roam evolves, but by following these simple rules,
extensions can be made robust to local changes in Org-roam.

   • Extensions should not modify the database schema.  Any extension
     that requires the caching of additional data should make a request
     upstream to Org-roam.

   • Extensions requiring access to the database should explicitly state
     support for the database version (‘org-roam-db-version’), and only
     conditionally load when support is available.

* Accessing and Modifying Nodes::
* Extending the Capture System::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Accessing the Database,  Next: Accessing and Modifying Nodes,  Up: Building Extensions and Advanced Customization of Org-roam

17.2.1 Accessing the Database
-----------------------------

Access to the database is provided singularly by ‘org-roam-db-query’,
for example:

     (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from nodes])

   One can refer to the database schema by looking up
‘org-roam-db--table-schemata’.  There are multiple helper functions
within Org-roam that call ‘org-roam-db-query’, these are subject to
change.  To ensure that extensions/customizations are robust to change,
extensions should only use ‘org-roam-db-query’, and perhaps replicate
the SQL query if necessary.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Accessing and Modifying Nodes,  Next: Extending the Capture System,  Prev: Accessing the Database,  Up: Building Extensions and Advanced Customization of Org-roam

17.2.2 Accessing and Modifying Nodes
------------------------------------

The node interface is cleanly defined using ‘cl-defstruct’.  The primary
method to access nodes is ‘org-roam-node-at-point’ and
‘org-roam-node-read’:

 -- Function: org-roam-node-at-point &optional assert

     Return the node at point.  If ASSERT, throw an error if there is no
     node at point.

 -- Function: org-roam-node-read &optional initial-input filter-fn
          sort-fn
     require-match

     Read and return an ‘org-roam-node’.  INITIAL-INPUT is the initial
     minibuffer prompt value.  FILTER-FN is a function to filter out
     nodes: it takes a single argument (an ‘org-roam-node’), and when
     nil is returned the node will be filtered out.  SORT-FN is a
     function to sort nodes.  See
     ‘org-roam-node-read-sort-by-file-mtime’ for an example sort
     function.  If REQUIRE-MATCH, the minibuffer prompt will require a
     match.

   Once you obtain the node, you can use the accessors for the node,
e.g.  ‘org-roam-node-id’ or ‘org-roam-node-todo’.

   It is possible to define (or override existing) properties on nodes.
This is simply done using a ‘cl-defmethod’ on the ‘org-roam-node’
struct:

     (cl-defmethod org-roam-node-namespace ((node org-roam-node))
       "Return the namespace for NODE.
     The namespace is the final directory of the file for the node."
       (file-name-nondirectory
        (directory-file-name
         (file-name-directory (org-roam-node-file node)))))

   The snippet above defines a new property ‘namespace’ on
‘org-roam-node’, which making it available for use in capture templates.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Extending the Capture System,  Prev: Accessing and Modifying Nodes,  Up: Building Extensions and Advanced Customization of Org-roam

17.2.3 Extending the Capture System
-----------------------------------

Org-roam applies some patching over Org’s capture system to smooth out
the user experience, and sometimes it is desirable to use Org-roam’s
capturing system instead.  The exposed function to be used in extensions
is ‘org-roam-capture-’:

 -- Function: org-roam-capture- &key goto keys node info props templates

     Main entry point.  GOTO and KEYS correspond to ‘org-capture’
     arguments.  INFO is a plist for filling up Org-roam’s capture
     templates.  NODE is an ‘org-roam-node’ construct containing
     information about the node.  PROPS is a plist containing additional
     Org-roam properties for each template.  TEMPLATES is a list of
     org-roam templates.

   An example of an extension using ‘org-roam-capture-’ is
‘org-roam-dailies’ itself:

     (defun org-roam-dailies--capture (time &optional goto)
       "Capture an entry in a daily-note for TIME, creating it if necessary.

     When GOTO is non-nil, go the note without creating an entry."
       (org-roam-capture- :goto (when goto '(4))
                          :node (org-roam-node-create)
                          :templates org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
                          :props (list :override-default-time time))
       (when goto (run-hooks 'org-roam-dailies-find-file-hook)))
