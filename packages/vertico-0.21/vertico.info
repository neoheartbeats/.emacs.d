1 Introduction
**************

Vertico provides a performant and minimalistic vertical completion UI
based on the default completion system.  The main focus of Vertico is to
provide a UI which behaves _correctly_ under all circumstances.  By
reusing the built-in facilities system, Vertico achieves _full
compatibility_ with built-in Emacs completion commands and completion
tables.  Vertico only provides the completion UI but aims to be highly
flexible, extensible and modular.  Additional enhancements are available
as *note extensions: Extensions. or *note complementary packages:
Complementary packages.  The code base is small and maintainable.  The
main ‘vertico.el’ package is only about 600 lines of code without white
space and comments.

2 Features
**********

   • Vertical display with arrow key navigation.  See the *note
     extensions: Extensions. for additional display modes.
   • Prompt shows the current candidate index and the total number of
     candidates.
   • The current candidate is inserted with ‘TAB’ and selected with
     ‘RET’.
   • Non-existing candidates can be submitted with ‘M-RET’ or by moving
     the point to the prompt.
   • Configurable sorting by history position, length and
     alphabetically.
   • Long candidates with newlines are formatted to take up less space.
   • Deferred completion style highlighting for performance.
   • Annotations are displayed next to the candidates (‘annotation-’ and
     ‘affixation-function’).
   • Support for candidate grouping and group cycling commands
     (‘group-function’).

3 Key bindings
**************

Vertico defines its own local keymap in the minibuffer which is derived
from ‘minibuffer-local-map’.  The keymap keeps most of the
‘fundamental-mode’ keybindings intact and remaps and binds only a
handful of commands.  Note in particular the binding of ‘TAB’ to
‘vertico-insert’ and the bindings of ‘vertico-exit/exit-input’.

   • ‘beginning-of-buffer’, ‘minibuffer-beginning-of-buffer’ ->
     ‘vertico-first’
   • ‘end-of-buffer’ -> ‘vertico-last’
   • ‘scroll-down-command’ -> ‘vertico-scroll-down’
   • ‘scroll-up-command’ -> ‘vertico-scroll-up’
   • ‘next-line’, ‘next-line-or-history-element’ -> ‘vertico-next’
   • ‘previous-line’, ‘previous-line-or-history-element’ ->
     ‘vertico-previous’
   • ‘forward-paragraph’ -> ‘vertico-next-group’
   • ‘backward-paragraph’ -> ‘vertico-previous-group’
   • ‘exit-minibuffer’ -> ‘vertico-exit’
   • ‘kill-ring-save’ -> ‘vertico-save’
   • ‘M-RET’ -> ‘vertico-exit-input’
   • ‘TAB’ -> ‘vertico-insert’

4 Configuration
***************

Vertico is available from GNU ELPA
(http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/vertico.html).  You can install it
directly via ‘package-install’.  After installation, you can activate
the global minor mode with ‘M-x vertico-mode’.  In order to configure
Vertico and other packages in your init.el, you may want to take
advantage of ‘use-package’.  I recommend to give Orderless completion a
try, which is different from the prefix TAB completion used by the basic
default completion system or in shells.  Here is an example
configuration:

     ;; Enable vertico
     (use-package vertico
       :init
       (vertico-mode)

       ;; Different scroll margin
       ;; (setq vertico-scroll-margin 0)

       ;; Show more candidates
       ;; (setq vertico-count 20)

       ;; Grow and shrink the Vertico minibuffer
       ;; (setq vertico-resize t)

       ;; Optionally enable cycling for `vertico-next' and `vertico-previous'.
       ;; (setq vertico-cycle t)
       )

     ;; Optionally use the `orderless' completion style. See
     ;; `+orderless-dispatch' in the Consult wiki for an advanced Orderless style
     ;; dispatcher. Additionally enable `partial-completion' for file path
     ;; expansion. `partial-completion' is important for wildcard support.
     ;; Multiple files can be opened at once with `find-file' if you enter a
     ;; wildcard. You may also give the `initials' completion style a try.
     (use-package orderless
       :init
       ;; Configure a custom style dispatcher (see the Consult wiki)
       ;; (setq orderless-style-dispatchers '(+orderless-dispatch)
       ;;       orderless-component-separator #'orderless-escapable-split-on-space)
       (setq completion-styles '(orderless)
             completion-category-defaults nil
             completion-category-overrides '((file (styles partial-completion)))))

     ;; Persist history over Emacs restarts. Vertico sorts by history position.
     (use-package savehist
       :init
       (savehist-mode))

     ;; A few more useful configurations...
     (use-package emacs
       :init
       ;; Add prompt indicator to `completing-read-multiple'.
       ;; Alternatively try `consult-completing-read-multiple'.
       (defun crm-indicator (args)
         (cons (concat "[CRM] " (car args)) (cdr args)))
       (advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :filter-args #'crm-indicator)

       ;; Do not allow the cursor in the minibuffer prompt
       (setq minibuffer-prompt-properties
             '(read-only t cursor-intangible t face minibuffer-prompt))
       (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'cursor-intangible-mode)

       ;; Emacs 28: Hide commands in M-x which do not work in the current mode.
       ;; Vertico commands are hidden in normal buffers.
       ;; (setq read-extended-command-predicate
       ;;       #'command-completion-default-include-p)

       ;; Enable recursive minibuffers
       (setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t))

   See also the Vertico Wiki (https://github.com/minad/vertico/wiki) for
additional configuration tips.  For more general documentation read the
chapter about completion in the Emacs manual
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Completion.html).
If you want to create your own completion commands, you can find
documentation about completion in the Elisp manual
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html).

4.1 Completion styles and TAB completion
========================================

The bindings of the ‘minibuffer-local-completion-map’ are not available
in Vertico by default.  This means that TAB works differently from what
you may expect from the default Emacs completion system.

   If you prefer to have the default completion commands a key press
away you can add new bindings or even replace the Vertico bindings.
Then the default completion commands behave as usual.  For example you
can use ‘M-TAB’ to cycle between candidates if you have set
‘completion-cycle-threshold’.

     (define-key vertico-map "?" #'minibuffer-completion-help)
     (define-key vertico-map (kbd "M-RET") #'minibuffer-force-complete-and-exit)
     (define-key vertico-map (kbd "M-TAB") #'minibuffer-complete)

   The ‘orderless’ completion style does not support completion of a
common prefix substring, as you may be familiar with from shells or the
basic default completion system.  The reason is that the Orderless input
string is usually not a prefix.  In order to support completing prefixes
you may want to combine ‘orderless’ with ‘substring’ in your
‘completion-styles’ configuration.

     (setq completion-styles '(substring orderless))

   Alternatively you can experiment with the built-in completion-styles,
e.g., adding ‘partial-completion’ or ‘flex’.  The ‘partial-completion’
style is important to add if you want to open multiple files at once
with ‘find-file’ using wildcards.  In order to open multiple files at
once, you have to move to the prompt and then press ‘RET’.

     (setq completion-styles '(basic substring partial-completion flex))

   Because Vertico is fully compatible with Emacs default completion
system, further customization of completion behavior can be achieved by
setting the designated Emacs variables.  For example, one may wish to
disable case-sensitivity for file and buffer matching when built-in
completion styles are used instead of ‘orderless’:

     (setq read-file-name-completion-ignore-case t
           read-buffer-completion-ignore-case t
           completion-ignore-case t)

4.2 Completion-at-point and completion-in-region
================================================

The ‘completion-at-point’ command is usually bound to ‘M-TAB’ or ‘TAB’.
In case you want to use Vertico for
completion-at-point/completion-in-region, you can use the function
‘consult-completion-in-region’ provided by the Consult package.

     ;; Use `consult-completion-in-region' if Vertico is enabled.
     ;; Otherwise use the default `completion--in-region' function.
     (setq completion-in-region-function
           (lambda (&rest args)
             (apply (if vertico-mode
                        #'consult-completion-in-region
                      #'completion--in-region)
                    args)))

   The ‘completion-in-region-function’ setting also affects TAB
completion in the minibuffer when ‘M-:’ (‘eval-expression’) is used.

   You may also want to look into my Corfu
(https://github.com/minad/corfu) package, which provides a minimal
completion system for ‘completion-in-region’ in a child frame popup.
Corfu is also a narrowly focused package and developed in the same
spirit as Vertico.

4.3 Completing-read-multiple (CRM)
==================================

Consult offers an enhanced ‘completing-read-multiple’ implementation
which you can use with Vertico.

5 Extensions
************

We maintain small extension packages to Vertico in this repository in
the subdirectory extensions/
(https://github.com/minad/vertico/tree/main/extensions).  The extensions
are installed together with Vertico if you pull the package from ELPA.
The extensions are inactive by default and can be enabled manually if
desired.  Furthermore it is possible to install all of the files
separately, both ‘vertico.el’ and the ‘vertico-*.el’ extensions.
Currently the following extensions come with the Vertico ELPA package:

   • vertico-buffer
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-buffer.el):
     ‘vertico-buffer-mode’ to display Vertico in a separate buffer.
   • vertico-directory
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-directory.el):
     Commands for Ido-like directory navigation.
   • vertico-flat
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-flat.el):
     ‘vertico-flat-mode’ to enable a flat, horizontal display.
   • vertico-grid
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-grid.el):
     ‘vertico-grid-mode’ to enable a grid display.
   • vertico-indexed
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-indexed.el):
     ‘vertico-indexed-mode’ to select indexed candidates with prefix
     arguments.
   • vertico-mouse
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-mouse.el):
     ‘vertico-mouse-mode’ to support for scrolling and candidate
     selection.
   • vertico-multiform
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-multiform.el):
     Configure Vertico modes per command or completion category.
   • vertico-quick
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-quick.el):
     Commands to select using Avy-style quick keys.
   • vertico-repeat
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-repeat.el):
     The command ‘vertico-repeat’ repeats the last completion session.
   • vertico-reverse
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-reverse.el):
     ‘vertico-reverse-mode’ to reverse the display.
   • vertico-unobtrusive
     (https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/main/extensions/vertico-unobtrusive.el):
     ‘vertico-unobtrusive-mode’ displays only the topmost candidate.

   With these extensions it is possible to adapt Vertico such that it
matches your preference or behaves similar to other familiar UIs.  For
example, the combination ‘vertico-flat’ plus ‘vertico-directory’
resembles Ido in look and feel.  For an interface similar to Helm, the
extension ‘vertico-buffer’ allows you to configure freely where the
completion buffer opens, instead of growing the minibuffer.  Furthermore
‘vertico-buffer’ will adjust the number of displayed candidates
according to the buffer height.

   Configuration example for ‘vertico-directory’:

     ;; Configure directory extension.
     (use-package vertico-directory
       :after vertico
       :ensure nil
       ;; More convenient directory navigation commands
       :bind (:map vertico-map
                   ("RET" . vertico-directory-enter)
                   ("DEL" . vertico-directory-delete-char)
                   ("M-DEL" . vertico-directory-delete-word))
       ;; Tidy shadowed file names
       :hook (rfn-eshadow-update-overlay . vertico-directory-tidy))

5.1 Configure Vertico per command or completion category
========================================================

<https://github.com/minad/vertico/blob/screenshots/vertico-ripgrep.png?raw=true>

   Vertico offers the ‘vertico-multiform-mode’ which allows you to
configure Vertico per command or per completion category.  The
‘vertico-buffer-mode’ enables a Helm-like buffer display, which takes
more space but also displays more candidates.  This verbose display mode
is useful for commands like ‘consult-imenu’ or ‘consult-outline’ since
the buffer display allows you to get a better overview over the entire
current buffer.  But for other commands you want to keep using the
default Vertico display.  ‘vertico-multiform-mode’ solves this
configuration problem!

     ;; Enable vertico-multiform
     (vertico-multiform-mode)

     ;; Configure the display per command.
     ;; Use a buffer with indices for imenu
     ;; and a flat (Ido-like) menu for M-x.
     (setq vertico-multiform-commands
           '((consult-imenu buffer indexed)
             (execute-extended-command unobtrusive)))

     ;; Configure the display per completion category.
     ;; Use the grid display for files and a buffer
     ;; for the consult-grep commands.
     (setq vertico-multiform-categories
           '((file grid)
             (consult-grep buffer)))

   Temporary toggling between the different display modes is possible.
Bind the following commands:

     (define-key vertico-map "\M-V" #'vertico-multiform-vertical)
     (define-key vertico-map "\M-G" #'vertico-multiform-grid)
     (define-key vertico-map "\M-F" #'vertico-multiform-flat)
     (define-key vertico-map "\M-R" #'vertico-multiform-reverse)
     (define-key vertico-map "\M-U" #'vertico-multiform-unobtrusive)

   You can use your own functions or even lambdas to configure the
completion behavior per command or per completion category.  The
function must have the calling convention of a mode, i.e., it takes a
single argument, which is either 1 to turn on the mode and -1 to turn
off the mode.

     ;; Configure `consult-outline' as a scaled down TOC in a separate buffer
     (setq vertico-multiform-commands
           `((consult-outline buffer ,(lambda (_) (text-scale-set -1)))))

   Furthermore you can tune buffer-local settings per command or
category.

     ;; Change the default sorting function
     (setq vertico-multiform-commands
           '((describe-symbol (vertico-sort-function . vertico-sort-alpha))))

     (setq vertico-multiform-categories
           '((symbol (vertico-sort-function . vertico-sort-alpha))
             (file (vertico-sort-function . sort-directories-first))))

     ;; Sort directories before files
     (defun sort-directories-first (files)
       (setq files (vertico-sort-history-length-alpha files))
       (nconc (seq-filter (lambda (x) (string-suffix-p "/" x)) files)
              (seq-remove (lambda (x) (string-suffix-p "/" x)) files)))

   Combining these features allows us to fine-tune the completion
display even more by adjusting the ‘vertico-buffer-display-action’.  We
can for example reuse the current window for commands of the
‘consult-grep’ category (‘consult-grep’, ‘consult-git-grep’ and
‘consult-ripgrep’).  Note that this configuration is incompatible with
Consult preview, since the previewed buffer is usually shown in exactly
this window.  Nevertheless this snippet demonstrates the flexibility of
the configuration system.

     ;; Configure the buffer display and the buffer display action
     (setq vertico-multiform-categories
           '((consult-grep
              buffer
              (vertico-buffer-display-action . (display-buffer-same-window)))))

     ;; Disable preview for consult-grep commands
     (consult-customize consult-ripgrep consult-git-grep consult-grep :preview-key nil)

   As another example, the following code uses ‘vertico-flat’ and
‘vertico-cycle’ to emulate ‘(ido-mode 'buffer)’, i.e., Ido when it is
enabled only for completion of buffer names.  ‘vertico-cycle’ set to ‘t’
is necessary here to prevent completion candidates from disappearing
when they scroll off-screen to the left.

     (setq vertico-multiform-categories
           '((buffer flat (vertico-cycle . t))))

6 Complementary packages
************************

Vertico integrates well with complementary packages, which enrich the
completion UI.  These packages are fully supported:

   • Marginalia (https://github.com/minad/marginalia): Rich annotations
     in the minibuffer
   • Consult (https://github.com/minad/consult): Useful search and
     navigation commands
   • Embark (https://github.com/oantolin/embark): Minibuffer actions and
     context menu
   • Orderless (https://github.com/oantolin/orderless): Advanced
     completion style

   In order to get accustomed with the package ecosystem, I recommed the
following quick start approach:

  1. Start with plain Emacs (‘emacs -Q’).
  2. Install and enable Vertico to get incremental minibuffer
     completion.
  3. Install Orderless and/or configure the built-in completion styles
     for more flexible minibuffer filtering.
  4. Install Marginalia if you like rich minibuffer annotations.
  5. Install Embark and add two keybindings for ‘embark-dwim’ and
     ‘embark-act’.  I am using the mnemonic keybindings ‘M-.’ and ‘C-.’
     since these commands allow you to act on the object at point or in
     the minibuffer.
  6. Install Consult if you want additional featureful completion
     commands, e.g., the buffer switcher ‘consult-buffer’ with preview
     or the line-based search ‘consult-line’.
  7. Install Embark-Consult and Wgrep for export from ‘consult-line’ to
     ‘occur-mode’ buffers and from ‘consult-grep’ to editable
     ‘grep-mode’ buffers.
  8. Fine tune Vertico with *note extensions: Extensions.

   The ecosystem is modular.  You don’t have to use all of these
components.  Use only the ones you like and the ones which fit well into
your setup.  The steps 1.  to 4.  introduce no new commands over plain
Emacs.  Step 5.  introduces the new commands ‘embark-act’ and
‘embark-dwim’.  In step 6.  you get the Consult commands, some offer new
functionality not present in Emacs already (e.g., ‘consult-line’) and
some are substitutes (e.g., ‘consult-buffer’ for ‘switch-to-buffer’).

7 Child frames and Popups
*************************

An often requested feature is the ability to display the completions in
a child frame popup.  Personally I am critical of using child frames for
minibuffer completion.  From my experience it introduces more problems
than it solves.  Most importantly child frames hide the content of the
underlying buffer.  Furthermore child frames do not play well together
with changing windows and entering recursive minibuffer sessions.  On
top, child frames can feel slow and sometimes flicker.  A better
alternative is the ‘vertico-buffer’ display which can even be configured
individually per command using ‘vertico-multiform’.  On the plus side of
child frames, the completion display appears at the center of the
screen, where your eyes are focused.  Please give the following packages
a try and judge for yourself.

   • mini-frame (https://github.com/muffinmad/emacs-mini-frame): Display
     the entire minibuffer in a child frame.
   • mini-popup (https://github.com/minad/mini-popup): Slightly simpler
     alternative to mini-frame.
   • vertico-posframe (https://github.com/tumashu/vertico-posframe):
     Display only the Vertico minibuffer in a child frame using the
     posframe library.

8 Alternatives
**************

There are many alternative completion UIs, each UI with its own
advantages and disadvantages.

   Vertico aims to be 100% compliant with all Emacs commands and
achieves that with a minimal code base, relying purely on
‘completing-read’ while avoiding to invent its own APIs.  Inventing a
custom API as Helm or Ivy is explicitly avoided in order to increase
flexibility and package reuse.  Due to its small code base and reuse of
the Emacs built-in facilities, bugs and compatibility issues are less
likely to occur in comparison to completion UIs or full completion
systems, which reimplement a lot of functionality.

   Since Vertico only provides the UI, you may want to combine it with
some of the complementary packages, to give a full-featured completion
experience similar to Helm or Ivy.  Overall the packages in the spirit
of Vertico have a different style than Helm or Ivy.  The idea is to have
smaller independent components, which one can add and understand step by
step.  Each component focuses on its niche and tries to be as
non-intrusive as possible.  Vertico targets users interested in crafting
their Emacs precisely to their liking - completion plays an integral
part in how the users interacts with Emacs.

   There are other interactive completion UIs, which follow a similar
philosophy:

   • Mct (https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct): Minibuffer and
     Completions in Tandem.  Mct reuses the default ‘*Completions*’
     buffer and enhances it with automatic updates and additional
     keybindings, to select a candidate and move between minibuffer and
     completions buffer.  Mct can be configured to open only when
     requested.  Furthermore since Mct uses a fully functional buffer
     you can reuse all your familar buffer commands inside the
     completions buffer.  The main distinction to Vertico’s approach is
     that ‘*Completions*’ buffer displays all matching candidates.  This
     has the advantage that you can interact freely with the candidates
     and jump around with Isearch or Avy.  On the other hand it
     necessarily causes a slowdown in comparison to Vertico, which only
     displays a subset of candidates.  Mct supports completion in region
     via its ‘mct-region-mode’.
   • Icomplete-vertical
     (https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical): This package
     enhances the Emacs builtin Icomplete with a vertical display.  In
     contrast to Vertico, Icomplete rotates the candidates such that the
     current candidate always appears at the top.  From my perspective,
     candidate rotation feels a bit less intuitive than the UI of
     Vertico or Selectrum.  Note that Emacs 28 offers a built-in
     ‘icomplete-vertical-mode’.
   • Selectrum (https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum): Selectrum is the
     predecessor of Vertico, since it directly inspired Vertico.
     Selectrum has a similar UI and interaction model as Vertico.
     Vertico offers additional features and is more flexible than
     Selectrum thanks to its *note extensions: Extensions.
     Unfortunately Selectrum is not fully compatible with every Emacs
     completion command and dynamic completion tables (Issue #481
     (https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/issues/481)), since it uses
     its own filtering infrastructure, which deviates from the standard
     Emacs completion facilities.  The filtering infrastructure also
     leads to a larger and more complex code base.

11 Problematic completion commands
**********************************

Vertico is robust in most scenarios.  However some completion commands
make certain assumptions about the completion styles and the completion
UI.  Some of these assumptions may not hold in Vertico or other UIs and
require minor workarounds.

* Menu:

* org-refile::
* tmm-menubar::
* ffap-menu::
* Submitting the empty string::
* Tramp hostname completion::


File: vertico.info,  Node: org-refile,  Next: tmm-menubar,  Up: Problematic completion commands

11.1 ‘org-refile’
=================

‘org-refile’ uses ‘org-olpath-completing-read’ to complete the outline
path in steps, when ‘org-refile-use-outline-path’ is non-nil.

   Unfortunately the implementation of this Org completion table assumes
that the ‘basic’ completion style is used.  The table is incompatible
with completion styles like ‘substring’, ‘flex’ or ‘orderless’.  In
order to fix the issue at the root, the completion table should make use
of completion boundaries similar to the built-in file completion table.
In your user configuration you can prioritize ‘basic’ before
‘orderless’.

     ;; Alternative 1: Use the basic completion style
     (setq org-refile-use-outline-path 'file
           org-outline-path-complete-in-steps t)
     (advice-add #'org-olpath-completing-read :around
                 (lambda (&rest args)
                   (minibuffer-with-setup-hook
                       (lambda () (setq-local completion-styles '(basic)))
                     (apply args))))

   Alternatively you may want to disable the outline path completion in
steps.  The completion on the full path can be quicker since the input
string matches directly against substrings of the full path, which is
useful with Orderless.  However the list of possible completions becomes
much more cluttered.

     ;; Alternative 2: Complete full paths
     (setq org-refile-use-outline-path 'file
           org-outline-path-complete-in-steps nil)

11.2 ‘tmm-menubar’
==================

The text menu bar works well with Vertico but always shows a
‘*Completions*’ buffer, which is unwanted if you use the Vertico UI.
This completion buffer can be disabled with an advice.  If you disabled
the standard GUI menu bar and prefer the Vertico interface you may also
overwrite the default F10 keybinding.

     (global-set-key [f10] #'tmm-menubar)
     (advice-add #'tmm-add-prompt :after #'minibuffer-hide-completions)

11.3 ‘ffap-menu’
================

The command ‘ffap-menu’ shows the ‘*Completions*’ buffer by default like
‘tmm-menubar’, which is unnecessary with Vertico.  This completion
buffer can be disabled as follows.

     (advice-add #'ffap-menu-ask :around (lambda (&rest args)
                                      (cl-letf (((symbol-function #'minibuffer-completion-help)
                                                 #'ignore))
                                        (apply args))))

11.4 Submitting the empty string
================================

The commands ‘multi-occur’, ‘auto-insert’, ‘bbdb-create’ read multiple
arguments from the minibuffer with ‘completing-read’, one at a time,
until you submit an empty string.  You should type ‘M-RET’
(‘vertico-exit-input’) to finish the loop.  Directly pressing ‘RET’
(‘vertico-exit’) does not work since the first candidate is preselected.

   The underlying issue is that ‘completing-read’ always allows you to
exit with the empty string, which is called the _null completion_, even
if the ‘REQUIRE-MATCH’ argument is non-nil.  Try the following two calls
to ‘completing-read’ with ‘C-x C-e’:

     (completing-read "Select: " '("first" "second" "third") nil 'require-match)
     (completing-read "Select: " '("first" "second" "third") nil 'require-match nil nil "")

   In both cases the empty string can be submitted.  In the first case
no explicit default value is specified and Vertico preselects the
*first* candidate.  In order to exit with the empty string, press
‘M-RET’.  In the second case the explicit default value "" is specified
and Vertico preselects the prompt, such that existing with the empty
string is possible by pressing ‘RET’ only.

11.5 Tramp hostname completion
==============================

In combination with Orderless, hostnames are not made available for
completion after entering ‘/ssh:’.  In order to avoid this problem, the
‘basic’ completion style should be specified for the file completion
category.

     (setq completion-styles '(orderless)
           completion-category-overrides '((file (styles basic partial-completion))))

   For users who are familiar with the ‘completion-style’ machinery: You
may also define a custom completion style which sets in only for remote
files!

     (defun basic-remote-try-completion (string table pred point)
       (and (vertico--remote-p string)
            (completion-basic-try-completion string table pred point)))
     (defun basic-remote-all-completions (string table pred point)
       (and (vertico--remote-p string)
            (completion-basic-all-completions string table pred point)))
     (add-to-list
      'completion-styles-alist
      '(basic-remote basic-remote-try-completion basic-remote-all-completions nil))
     (setq completion-styles '(orderless)
           completion-category-overrides '((file (styles basic-remote partial-completion))))
